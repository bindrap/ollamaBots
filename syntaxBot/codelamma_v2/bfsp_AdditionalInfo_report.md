The syntax and logic of the SQL code for the Additional Information Required process in the city project have been reviewed, and the following issues were identified:

1. Unexpected ResultCodes:
	* 1220 (In Progress)
	* 18040 (In Progress)
	* 23008 (Request Information)
	* 23001 (Additional Information Required)
	* 2003 (Pending Additional Information)
	* 23005 (Information Received)
	* 23004 (Completed)
	* 950 (Cancelled)

These ResultCodes are not in the project rules, and they may be causing issues with the logic of the process.
2. Missing ResultCodes:
	* None found

It is important to verify that these ResultCodes are correctly handled in the code, or add appropriate error handling to catch and handle any unexpected ResultCodes.
3. Status Changes:
	* Folder status updated to 'Pending Additional Information'

The code updates the folder status to 'Pending Additional Information', but it is not clear from the code whether this is the intended behavior or if there are other actions that need to be taken in addition to updating the status.
4. Unused Blocks:
	* None found

It is important to identify and remove any redundant or unused code blocks to ensure that the process logic is clean and easy to understand.
5. Best Practices:
	* Use named variables instead of positional parameters to improve readability and maintainability of the code.
	* Add error handling using TRY/CATCH block to catch and handle any errors or exceptions in the code.
	* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle should be followed to avoid duplicating code and make the process more maintainable.
	* Use descriptive variable names that accurately reflect their purpose, and avoid using abbreviations or shortened versions of words that may not be immediately clear to other developers.
	* Consider using a different naming convention for variables than what is used in the code, such as camelCase or snake_case, to improve readability and consistency throughout the codebase.
