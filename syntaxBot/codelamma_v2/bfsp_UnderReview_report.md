The SQL file `bfsp_UnderReview.sql` contains a number of syntax errors and warnings, as well as logic or rule violations that need to be addressed. The following are some of the issues found in the code:

### Syntax Errors / Warnings:

* Line 27: Unexpected ResultCode `950` (not in rules)
* Line 53: Unexpected ResultCode `1220` (not in rules)
* Line 59: Unexpected ResultCode `18040` (not in rules)
* Line 65: Unexpected ResultCode `2004` (not in rules)
* Line 81: Unexpected ResultCode `2008` (not in rules)
* Line 93: Unexpected ResultCode `2025` (not in rules)
* Line 105: Unexpected ResultCode `1000` (not in rules)
* Line 114: Unexpected ResultCode `24051` (not in rules)

* Line 129: Unexpected ResultCode `2004` (not in rules)
* Line 134: Unexpected ResultCode `34024` (not in rules)
* Line 146: Unexpected ResultCode `3075` (not in rules)
* Line 164: Unexpected ResultCode `30070` (not in rules)
* Missing TRY/CATCH error handling
* Too many UPDATEs â€“ consider DRY principle

### Logic or Rule Violations:

* The code updates the process status to `In Progress` when it should update the folder status instead.
* The code updates the folder status to `Pending Additional Information` without checking whether additional information has been provided.
* The code updates the process status to `Under Review` without checking whether the request for additional information is valid.
* The code updates the folder status to `On Hold` without checking whether the request for additional information is valid.
* The code updates the process status to `Pending Additional Information` without checking whether additional information has been provided.
* The code updates the folder status to `Under Review` without checking whether the request for additional information is valid.
* The code updates the process status to `On Hold` without checking whether the request for additional information is valid.
* The code updates the folder status to `Denied` without checking whether the denial reason has been provided.
* The code updates the process status to `Closed` without checking whether the denial reason has been provided.
* The code sends a notification email to the applicant for both approval and denial, but only checks for the approval reason in the condition.
* The code does not check for duplicate entries or conflicting updates.
* The code does not consider the possibility of multiple users updating the same process at the same time.
* The code does not consider the possibility of a process being updated after it has been closed.

### Suggested Fixes:

To fix these issues, we recommend the following changes:

1. Update the folder status instead of the process status when the result code is `2004`.
2. Check whether additional information has been provided before updating the folder status to `Pending Additional Information`.
3. Check whether the request for additional information is valid before updating the process status to `Under Review`.
4. Check whether the request for additional information is valid before updating the folder status to `On Hold`.
5. Check whether additional information has been provided before updating the folder status to `Pending Additional Information` when the result code is `24051`.
6. Check whether the request for additional information is valid before updating the process status to `Under Review` when the result code is `24051`.
7. Check whether the request for additional information is valid before updating the folder status to `On Hold` when the result code is `24051`.
8. Check whether the denial reason has been provided before updating the folder status to `Denied` and process status to `Closed`.
9. Send a notification email to the applicant only for approval.
10. Use TRY/CATCH error handling to catch any errors that may occur during updates.
11. Consider using a more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach to reduce code duplication.
