Here's an analysis of the SQL code for the "Additional Information Required" process in the city project:

1. **ResultCodes**: The following ResultCodes are found in the code: [(22, '1220'), (27, '18040'), (35, '23008'), (53, '23001'), (61, '2003'), (71, '23005'), (81, '23011'), (90, '23004'), (117, '23000'), (132, '23000'), (156, '950')]. However, there are also ResultCodes that are not in the rules: [(1220), (18040), (23008), (23001), (2003), (23005), (23011), (23004), (950)].
2. **Missing ResultCodes**: The following ResultCodes are missing from the code: [(22, '1220'), (27, '18040'), (35, '23008'), (53, '23001'), (61, '2003'), (71, '23005'), (81, '23011'), (90, '23004'), (117, '23000'), (132, '23000'), (156, '950')].
3. **Status Changes**: The code updates the status of the folder and process to "Pending Additional Information" using the following statement: `EXEC dbo.cp_UpdateFolder  @FolderRSN = @FolderRSN, @StatusCode = 2003;`.
4. **Unused Blocks**: There are no unused blocks in the code.
5. **Best Practices**: The code violates several best practices:
	* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: The code updates the status of the folder and process multiple times using different ResultCodes. This can be optimized by using a single UPDATE statement that sets the status to "Pending Additional Information".
	* **Error Handling**: There is no TRY/CATCH error handling in the code, which can make it difficult to identify and fix errors.
	* **Variable Declarations**: The code declares variables using different naming conventions (`@ResultCode`, `@FolderRSN`, `@ProcessRSN`, `@StatusCode`, etc.). Using a consistent naming convention for variables can improve readability and maintainability of the code.
