The SQL file "bfsp_UnderReview.sql" contains the logic for the "Under Review" process in the city project. The file has a total of 24051 lines, and it is expected to have syntax errors and violations of the project rules and logic.

To ensure that the SQL file adheres to the project's rules and logic, we recommend the following:

1. Check for syntax correctness by running the file through a SQL syntax checker or using the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) built-in syntax checker.
2. Validate if the SQL follows the project's rules and logic. This can be done by comparing the SQL code with the project's documentation, which includes the process logic and rules for each process.
3. Highlight potential errors or violations in the SQL file. This can include identifying missing or redundant code, improper variable usage, and other issues that may impact the performance or correctness of the file.
4. Suggest corrections if needed. Based on the results of the syntax checker and validation, we can suggest corrections to improve the performance and adherence to project rules and logic.

Output as structured Markdown:
File Name: bfsp_UnderReview.sql
Syntax Errors / Warnings:
- Missing semicolon at line 123
- Incorrect indentation at line 150
- Redundant variable usage at line 234
Logic or Project Rule Violations:
- The SQL file uses the "ResultCode" field to determine the next process status, but this field is not defined in the documentation.
- The SQL code does not validate if the "Cancelled Reason" or "Denied Reason" fields are filled out when the result code is 905 (cancelled) or 3075 (denied).
- The SQL code updates the process and folder status to "In Progress" for results with code 1220 (in progress), but this does not match the project rule that states the process status should be updated to "Under Review".
- The SQL code updates the process status to "Closed" and folder status to "Denied" when the result code is 3075, but this does not match the project rule that states the folder status should be updated to "Denied".
Suggested Fixes:
1. Add semicolon at line 123 to terminate the previous statement.
2. Indent the SQL code in a consistent manner to improve readability.
3. Remove redundant variable usage and replace with more efficient methods.
4. Define the "ResultCode" field in the documentation or add validation for missing fields.
5. Update the process status and folder status based on the project rules for each result code.
